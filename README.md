# Aim: To study and implement Operators in C++

# Software Required:
Visual  Studio

# Theory:
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provide the following types of operators −
1. Arithmetic Operators

2. Relational Operators

3. Logical Operators

4. Bitwise Operators

5. Assignment Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic operators in C++ are the basic operators, which are used for basic mathematical or arithmetical operations on operands. These operators are essential for performing calculations and manipulating data within a program.
There are following arithmetic operators supported by C++ language,

2. Relational Operators:

Relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions. These operators return a boolean value − true if the comparison is correct, and else false.
They are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program based on conditions.
There are following relational operators supported by C++ language,

3. Logical Operators:

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (true or false). These operators are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on conditions. There are three primary logical operators in C++ as mentioned below −
There are following logical operators supported by C++ language,

4.  Bitwise Operators:
   
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations at the bit level on integer data types. These operations work on direct manipulation of bits, such as low-level programming, graphics, and cryptography.

5.  Assignment Operators:

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. These operators allow you to set or update the value stored in a variable.

# Implementation:
In this practical I have used different types of operators in the following cases,

1. Positive or Negative number check:

This uses the comparition operators which help to identify negative and positive numbers.

2. Student grade Determination:

This uses the mix of Comparision and Logical Operators to alot grades according to the average marks in the 5 subjects.

3. Quadrant Determination:

This also uses the mix of Comparision and Logical Operators to determine the quadrant according to the coordinates , which are entered by the user.

# Conclusion:
I explored various Types of Operators in C++ and understood the usage of the operators.
